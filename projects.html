  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>A small selection of the things I have created over the last few years. You'll find many more of them over at my <a href="https://github.com/dayvidwhy" target="_blank">Github</a> account page. Most are graciously hosted on Github Pages.</p>
  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for project in site.data.projects %}

      <h2>
        <a class="post-link" style="color: {{ project.theme_colour }}" href="{{ project.link }}">{{ project.title | escape }}</a>
      </h2>
