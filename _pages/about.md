# About
I have been making websites for the past few years and enjoy writing about my discoveries.

I have since built a few projects and constantly find myself reading blogs or watching talks online as I strive to expand my knowledge on the seemingly endless topic of web development.

# Languages
Some of the programming languages I speak are listed below.
{% for language in site.data.programming_languages %}
* {{ language }}
{% endfor %}

I also enjoy using frameworks such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which I used to build this website!
