# About

My name is David Young. I have been making websites for the past few years and enjoy writing about my discoveries. I obtained a degree in Information Technology from the [University of Queensland](http://uq.edu.au) in 2016, and previously worked as a tutor, teaching first year website development there.

I initially obtained a Civil Engineering degree from UQ, however I took a programming course in my final semester of study and have been hooked since. I started out my second degree with the expectation of building desktop programs, however I have taken a strong interest in the web and what it has to offer.

I have since built a few projects and constantly find myself reading blogs or watching talks online as I strive to expand my knowledge on the seemingly endless topic of web development.

# Languages

Some of the programming languages I speak are listed below.
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript/ES6+
* PHP
* Python
* Java
* C

I also enjoy using frameworks such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which I used to build this website!
