# About

## Bio.
My name is David Young. I have been making websites for the past few years and enjoy writing about my discoveries. I obtained a degree in Information Technology from the [University of Queensland](http://uq.edu.au) and work as a tutor teaching first year website development there.

## Interests
I can normally be found behind a computer screen moving some margins or uploading some website and consider myself highly capable of producing responsive web solutions.

I am experienced in using Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP on the back-end to deliver high performance online solutions.

## Contact
If you have any responses to my posts please let me know and I'll be sure to get back to you. I'm very interested in mobile web performance and cross browser solutions.
