I finished a degree in Civil Engineering in 2013 and went back to University in 2014 after I realised that the software industry was the way of the future.  I'm looking to finish up a Bachelors of Information Technology as soon as possible so I can move into the professional workforce developing high impact websites for the modern web.

I can normally be found behind a computer screen moving some margins or uploading some website and consider myself highly capable of producing responsive web solutions.  I am experienced in using the Linux, Apache2, MySQL and PHP server stack to deliver high performance online solutions and I am available for small website designs or technical support.

Other skills include Python, Java, C, JSON, command-line tools.
