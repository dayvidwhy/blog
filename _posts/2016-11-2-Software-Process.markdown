Something I've been struggling to understand is why some students dislike courses that attempt to teach the software process, and that apparently those are a waste of time. I would like to take a moment to give you reasons as to why this is important learning material.

## Working Together
I have reached the end of my time at university and feel like I've learnt so many things, with probably the most important one being how to work with others to build software. While there are a number of courses that teach the basics of languages, and I feel like I've come out with a good knowledge of C, Java, Python, JavaScript and other web languages such as PHP, these are really just the _tools_ we use to make great things.

>Languages are the tools for building great things.

Courses that focus on teaching these tools are very important, but for the longest time at university I was wondering how people effectively work together to actually get stuff done.

### Collaborative Process
I have been learning a lot through a few courses at university on how to collaborate effectively. The biggest improvement to my learning was picking up git and getting started with github. But everyone knows that, git is the defacto "let's work together" piece of software. But there are more.

### Using Tools
For each of my group project courses in my final year I found myself working in a pretty standard manner. We would always setup [Slack](http://slack.com), [Trello](http://trello.com) and a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and use all of these to work together.

Trello really is invaluable for working together. Github [recently introduced](https://github.com/blog/2272-introducing-projects-for-organizations) their own project slash Trello board like tracking system and it's amazing. Trello works in a similar way where you can create small 'tickets' that you assign to people, similar to github issues. Being able to look over these tickets is great for tracking your team.

Slack has also been vastly important although the uptake from team members has sometimes been a struggle..

>Why don't we just use facebook messenger?

.. with some just wanting to go on facebook. But I insist that while I am friends with you, we are working on a professional project for the university, and slack is much more appropriate for this. It's ability to easily search for old messages and upload documents and keep track of them is much better than alternates.

### Agile Processes
There are a few courses at university that attempt to teach Agile, and the concepts of Scrum, to students. After doing courses like CSSE3002, the software process, and DECO3800/3801, final year design and build, I can safely say I am experienced with these. They even put marks towards using your Trello board consistently to operate in this manner which really pushes students to come out with these skills.

What I learned this semester was how effective it was to work in short 'sprints' to get tasks finished. By setting short periods of time to achieve goals, the goals you set are much more reasonable and more likely to be completed. It also gives you a chance to finish a piece of content and get feedback on it right away from your client.

This links [back to another post](http://blog.davidyoung.tech/blog/2016/10/17/Getting-Feedback.html) I made about getting feedback and how important it is. By developing software in this manner you can get this valuable feedback constantly and effectively.

## Agile for Students
I was asked by one of my lecturers towards the end of this semester for feedback on the use of agile for students doing their final build course. While I feel that it is very useful setting goals for students to achieve it is in an awkward spot where you still have to deal with students that won't take it seriously enough.

If this was a workplace and people had spent a long time trying to get a job here, the process would be taken a lot more seriously, small checkpoints and sprints would be ahered to. However I'm still happy to have had the learning experience.

## Finally
I've had a lot of chances to work with others this semester to accomplish much larger tasks than I would be able to on my own in the same period of time. These tools and processes have been the reason things went so well.
