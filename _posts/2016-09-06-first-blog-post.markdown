It seems apt to describe interesting things I've found myself getting up to while learning to code and I would like to share some of said things, most likely to affirm my own understanding, but also because why not.

I've been studying programming for 4 years now after having started early on with the python course CSSE1001 at UQ. Coding wasn't really something I found myself being interested in from a younger age, although I did enjoy messing with config files, I wasn't exactly writing full programs in any well defined language.

I hope to post some guides on interesting things I've managed to find over time, probably starting with some javascript and the slack bot hubot. After starting to tutor a course this semester I think I've gained a better understanding of some fundamental things I wish I had known earlier. Hopefully sharing those here helps some people.

Some of my [submissions](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/uqcs-hubot/pull/60) on github have been interesting. External API's are pretty easy to plug into and I do like using them to add interesting content to web pages or honestly anything that can initiate an `http` request.

You can find me in a few [places](https://davidyoung.tech) and I'm glad you took the time to read this, stay tuned for either more posts, or more cats, either way aren't they both positives?
