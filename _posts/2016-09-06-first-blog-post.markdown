It seems like something that everyone seems to need online these days and that's something to start venting thoughts and various thoughts had or ideas you'd like to share.

I've been studying programming for 4 years now having started early on with the python course CSSE1001 at UQ and have been going strong since.

I hope to post some guides on interesting things I've managed to find over time, probably starting with some javascript and the slack bot hubot.

Some of my [submissions](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/uqcs-hubot/pull/60) have been interesting so far. My biggest interest is dealing with external API's and using them to add interesting content to web pages in interesting ways.

You can find me in a few [places](https://davidyoung.tech) and I'm glad you took the time to read this.
