Feedback can really suck. That's not even an understatement, it can really stop you in your tracks and make you feel bad about what you've done. But sometimes that's a good thing.

## Handing It Out
I've been dealing with feedback in a few ways this semester at uni. Firstly I've been having to dish it out in the course I'm tutoring, which can be pretty daunting. It's a first year web course and students have put in loads of effort building really cool things, just to have their dreams shattered. I gave out some pretty harsh feedback this week critisizing this groups style and their UX flow and they mostly just stared at me in disbelief, and promptly suggested I didn't quite understand their app.

> You just aren't experienced with using this.

Well excuse me, I'm a user, and I'm just telling you how I felt about what I just experienced. One of the important concepts you need to pickup in your first year at uni is accepting what others say and making meaningful changes based on it. In successive courses your required, to get those precious marks, to say _how_ you are going to change things to meet these critiques.

> I'm not trying to crap on your ideas or your layout, but listen to me as a user, and think about why I gave this feedback.

Because you can learn a lot from listening to people.

## Getting It Back
Now to the receiving end. I've received a lot of feedback on work this year, from my final courses DECO2800/3800/3801. Working in groups while satisfying requirements is hard.

### DECO2800
This course has required me to work in a small group of 4 towards a project being undertaken by 60 students. We work on github in a private respository and use github issues to suggest changes and then commit code against those. 

Critiques from these have been rough so far but always so so helpful. 

>It can be hard to understand what you set out to do and if your meeting those requirements, if you stare at the code you wrote every day.

Thanks to our classmates telling us what we did wrong, or what we should do to improve our contributions, the games actually coming along quite well.

### DECO3800 and 3801
These courses meant we were liasing with a real client on an issue they wanted to solve. Real world clients are much harsher when something isn't what they asked for. This much blunter feedback is exactly what the development team typically needs though. So often people are afraid of getting feedback because they're worried about having done something wrong. 

>But if you never get any, how do you know you're doing it right in the first place?

## Finally
These courses have taught me much about listening to what people have to say about my software, letting people test things out, and watching where the pain points are.

Feedback can suck, really bad, but without it we would all be using software that's been designed way worse. Because of that I can only thank feedback for how amazing it is.
