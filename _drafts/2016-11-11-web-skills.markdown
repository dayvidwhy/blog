A few people have asked me recently how I'vve managed to make heads or tails of the current state of the web, and how do you get to a point where this weird online world of development doesn't freak you out too much. Well quite a lot of it confuses me but it's definitely become easier. I also feel like I can weigh in on this topic after tutoring this past semester and can suggest a few things that could increase anyones ability to make effective websites.

## Building Pages From Scratch
If there is one thing that really accelerated my understanding of and ability to write for the web was doing everything from scratch. Crazy I know. I reached a point where I became frustrated with how many different frameworks there were and the number of CSS templates out there were immense, looking at you Bootstrap, and I just could not deal with just using these classes. Just add a `form-control` class to that input field and it'll look pretty was not enough for me.

## Get Started With Semantics Now
The [semantic web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) is a standard that means the web will start making a lot more 'sense'. A lot of the data we put into pages has meaning beyond just the text we show. We can give our data more meaning quite easily. The latest thing I've become a fan of is the `itemprop` syntax.

## Inspect Everything
One of the best things you can do while learning is to just inspect almost every page you come across. Look inside the head tag, look at the properties they gave their `<p>` tags and look at what classes they used and why. Look at how they lay out their content. Did they use a grid or are they using flexbox?

## Pick a Framework
