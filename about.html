  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>My name is David Young. I have been making websites for the past few years and enjoy writing about my discoveries. I obtained a degree in Information Technology from the <a href="http://uq.edu.au">University of Queensland</a> and previously worked as a tutor teaching first year website development there.</p>
  <p>I previously studied Civil Engineering, however I took a programming course in my final semester of study and have been hooked on programming since. I started out my second degree with the expectation of building desktop programs however I have taken a strong interest in the web and what it has to offer.</p>
  <p>I have since built a few projects and always find myself reading blogs and watching talks online attempting to expand my knowledge on the seemingly endless topic of web development.</p>
  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p>I can normally be found behind a computer screen moving some margins or uploading some website and consider myself highly capable of producing responsive web solutions.</p>
  <p>I am very interested in web performance on mobile and what it means to make sites accessible to a wide range of people on various devices.</p>
  <p>I am experienced in using Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP on the back-end to deliver high performance online solutions.</p>
  <h1>Contact Me</h1>
  <p>If you have any responses to my posts please let me know and I'll be sure to get back to you. I'm very interested in mobile web performance and cross browser solutions.</p>
